# Mini Compiler Project

**Author:** Moumita Afreen  
**Department:** CSE, University of Asia Pacific  

## Overview
This project is a **Mini Compiler** developed in **Python** using **PLY (Lex & Yacc)** and **Tkinter**.  
It demonstrates the core stages of compilation including lexical analysis, syntax and semantic checking, symbol table management, intermediate code generation, assembly-like code generation, and provides a graphical interface for interactive compilation.

---

## Features
- Tokenizes source code into **keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and symbols**  
- Detects **syntax and semantic errors**, such as undeclared variables and redeclarations  
- Generates **Three-Address Code (Intermediate Code)**  
- Converts intermediate code into a simple **assembly-like representation**  
- Provides a **Tkinter GUI** to visualize all compilation stages  

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- PLY library: install with `pip install ply`  
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)  

---

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd mini-compiler


## Usage

1. **Run the compiler:**
```bash
python main.py

****Sample Input
```c
int a;
int b;
a = 5;
b = 10;
if (a < b) {
    a = a + b;
} else {
    b = b - a;
}
while (a > 0) {
    a = a - 1;
}

****Outputs

Tokens generated by lexical analysis

Symbol Table displaying all declared variables

Intermediate Code (Three-Address Code)

Assembly-like Code

Error messages for lexical, syntax, and semantic errors
