## Overview
This project is a **Mini Compiler** developed in **Python** using **PLY (Lex & Yacc)** and **Tkinter**.  
It demonstrates the core stages of compilation including lexical analysis, syntax and semantic checking, symbol table management, intermediate code generation, assembly-like code generation, and provides a graphical interface for interactive compilation.

---

## Features
- Tokenizes source code into **keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and symbols**  
- Detects **syntax and semantic errors**, such as undeclared variables and redeclarations  
- Generates **Three-Address Code (Intermediate Code)**  
- Converts intermediate code into a simple **assembly-like representation**  
- Provides a **Tkinter GUI** to visualize all compilation stages

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- PLY library: install with `pip install ply`  
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
